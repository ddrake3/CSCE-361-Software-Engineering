1. It only took a few hours to modify the game to beplayable with 6 and 7 sided dice.  It only took changing about
60 lines of code to complete. It did not seem like it was that hard of a job.

2. You woulf have to modify the menu, d7.json and possibly bonas category.

3. Using the knoledge I had before this course, it would have been very hard to make the changes. It probably would 
have taken completely rewriting the whole program to achieve. As far as time, a good estimate would be weeks.

4. It makes it incredibly more maintainable. Changing a few lines of code is much better than having to change the 
entire program.

5. As far as I can tell, it would only take changing d7.json. Changing one file is way easier than changing a whole
program.

6. it looks like it would take changing at least 15 lines of code just to change the menu. It looks like it would
about changes to about 4 lines of code to modify the enum based menu.
