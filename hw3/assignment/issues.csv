Title,Description
Write AbstractSubject,Implement the methods in AbstractSubject to provide the behavior required of the subject in the Observer Pattern
Use the Observer Pattern,"Remove the line in which DiceController updates the view with each die's new value, and change Die.roll() and AbstractDieView.update() to work with the Observer Pattern"
Set up the Template Method Pattern,"Create a an abstract method in AbstractDieBasedCategory, and implement getHypotheticalScore to use it"
Implement NumberCategory,Implement the methods in NumberCategory for the Left-Side scoring categories
Implement AbstractMatchingCategory,Implement the method in the intermediate class for the categories that rely on dice matching other dice
Implement OfAKindCategory,"Implement the methods in OfAKindCategory for the Right-Side categories that expect only a single group of matching dice (One Pair, Three of a Kind, etc)"
Implement OfTwoKindsCategory,"Implement the methods in OfTwoKindsCategory for the Right-Side categories that expect two groups of matching dice (Two Pair, Full Hosue)"
Implement SequenceCategory,Implement the methods in SeqeuenceCategory for the Right-Side categories that expect a contiguous sequence of dice (Small & Large Striaghts)
Implement ChanceCategory,Implement the methods in ChanceCategory for the Right-Side category that accepts any dice
Create remaining number-based categories,Modify ScoreController.addLeftCategories to create the remaining Left-Side categories
Implement the execute method for die-based scoring commands,Implement AbstratDieBasedScoringCommand.execute
Implement command for one pair,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for two pair,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for three of a kind,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for four of a kind,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for small straight,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for large straight,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
Implement command for yatzy,Should be a subclass of AbstractDieBasedScoringCommand. Might be the same class as for other categories. Modfiy ScoreController.addRightCategories to create this category.
